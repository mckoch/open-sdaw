Tools to read and write the SDAW Format "Standarddatensatz Au√üenwerbung"


##A collection

This is the master brach for a toolset to read and write a common format of the german advertising industry. 
It contains code to read sdaw files from Windows, export them to a SQL database, some PHP classes to query, and a Javascript/jQuery based interface using google maps.

This collection is not plug-and-play, but provides a lot of "how to" to the application programmer, since the sdaw format has only very few public available documentation.
